## Nice to meet you!
### I'm Shanivi Srikonda, a first-year at Harvard in the Class of 2024 concentrating in Biomedical Engieering.

**I'm really interested in science and research! I love to learn new things and understand how and why things work!**

Writing and computer science are also things I like to explore, and I'm looking forward to learning a lot over the next four years and beyond. I also enjoy literature, art, and film. I'm also a big fan of the outdoors and exploring nature, and it was really cool to experience my first Boston snow this past fall!
