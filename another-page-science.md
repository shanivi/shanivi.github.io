### Role of Poly-ADP(Ribose) Polymerase-1 in Trophoblast Differentiation
**UT Southwestern Medican Center, Dallas, Texas**

**Kraus Lab, Green Center for Reproductive Biology Sciences**

For this project, a cell culture model of placental trophoblast differentiation was used in order to identify PARP inhibitors that would block the activity of PARP-1 while also not causing cytotoxicity. This research project required PARP inhibitor assays as one large component of experimentation, and cell growth/toxicity assays as another large component, while I additionally performed other laboratory techniques such as Bradford assays. I also did a significant amount of Western blotting; I went through the entire process a multitude of times, even making my own gels. From the lysis process and protein quantitation steps to finally exposing and imaging the blots, as well as stripping and reprobing, I eventually gained the skill of being able to effectively Western blot and showcase my results. After experimentation, I worked on analyzing my data and finding ways to effectively present and communicate it with the help of my mentor. I ultimately created a research poster which I presented at the STARS poster session at the end of my eight weeks in the lab, as well as having the opportunity to present my project at a lab meeting in the Kraus Lab. I also presented both my poster and a presentation of my research later in October 2019 at Irving High Schoolâ€™s Biomedical Sciences Academy Science Emissary Presentation.
