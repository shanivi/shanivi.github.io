### Role of Poly-ADP(Ribose) Polymerase-1 in Trophoblast Differentiation

**Summer 2019** 

> UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas
>
> Kraus Lab, Green Center for Reproductive Biology Sciences

For this project, a cell culture model of placental trophoblast differentiation was used in order to identify PARP inhibitors that would block the activity of PARP-1 while also not causing cytotoxicity. 

This research project required PARP inhibitor assays as one large component of experimentation, and cell growth/toxicity assays as another large component, while I additionally performed other laboratory techniques such as Bradford assays. I also did a significant amount of Western blotting; I went through the entire process a multitude of times, even making my own gels. From the lysis process and protein quantitation steps to finally exposing and imaging the blots, as well as stripping and reprobing, I eventually gained the skill of being able to effectively Western blot and showcase my results. 

I ultimately created a research poster which I presented at the UT Southwestern STARS poster session at the end of my eight weeks in the lab, as well as having the opportunity to present my project at a lab meeting in the Kraus Lab. I also presented both my poster and a presentation of my research later in October 2019 at Irving High Schoolâ€™s Biomedical Sciences Academy Science Emissary Presentation.

### Human Perception and Time of Day Determination Based on Visual Cues

**Summer 2019**

> Pioneer Academics, Virtual Research Program
>
> Neuroscience Division

Collaborated with a Johns Hopkins professor in the neuroscience program topic, "Vision
Impossible: An Introduction to the Psychology and Neuroscience of Seeing." 

For my project, I conducted research virtually based on a perception-centered survey experiment and wrote a paper based on my findings. This research allowed me to acquire skills to more effectively conduct literature searches and write papers for journal submission, as well as how to synthesize researched sources into my own paper and cite them.

### Genetics of _C. elegans_ in Relation to Behavioral Expression

**August 2018 to January 2019**

> Dallas Regional Science and Engineering Fair, Dallas, Texas
>
> Cell and Molecular Biology Division

For this project, I explored the effects of bli-1 gene silencing through RNAi via feeding on the locomotion of _C. elegans_, ultimately to determine the impact of the produced blistered phenotype on organism behavior. I was mentored by a professor in the biology department at Texas Woman's University for this project.

This project was [awarded](https://www.sivb.org/InVitroReport/issue-53-3-july-september-2019/isef-high-school-student-awards-2/) Outstanding Achievement in In Vitro Biology from the Society for In Vitro Biology, and Honorable Mention in the Cell and Molecular Biology division.
