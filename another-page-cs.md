### _Frankenstein_ Twitter Bot

> Available [Here](https://twitter.com/BotFrankenstein)

Inspired by Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley's famous 1823 novel that facilitated the creation of the science-fiction genre, this Twitter bot tweets out lines from _Frankenstein_ approximately every four hours for fans of the novel to enjoy. I learned a lot about Twitter API and scripting through this project, and in creating this bot, I also saw new ways to script, which I can implement in futureprojects.
